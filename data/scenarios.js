Thanks to you, they're now able to work together and take advantage of everyone's strengths.",
		"lose_text": "Are you sure you selected all the right qualities and virtues? <br><br> While you'll need to look for powers that could help you win a baseball game, it's more important that you look for qualities that could help encourage the other players to work together as an effective team."

If Doctor NeverWrong had known that, he might never have become a Supervillain.",
